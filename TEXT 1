This is a highly complex and ambitious hypothetical scenario that integrates various scientific principles, including thermodynamics, nuclear physics, geophysics, and climate modeling. To address each of the points in your question, I will break the problem down into its components and attempt to derive mathematical calculations and conclusions based on these simplified models.

We will focus on the following core components:

Heat Absorption by Water (High Specific Heat Capacity): This includes the heat absorbed by the water from accelerated nuclear decay and environmental heating due to the Flood.
Effect of Salt on Specific Heat Capacity of Water: The salt content changes the specific heat capacity of water, so we will factor this in.
Evaporation of Water Due to Heating: As water absorbs heat, it will begin to evaporate, transferring heat to the atmosphere.
Plate Tectonics and Volcanism: Increased tectonic movement and volcanic activity as part of the Catastrophic Plate Tectonics (CPT) model will generate heat and affect climate dynamics.
Runaway Greenhouse Effect: We will consider the potential for a runaway greenhouse effect due to increased heat but also the cooling mechanisms that counteract this.
1. High Specific Heat Capacity of Water & Heat Absorption from Nuclear Decay
First, let's estimate the total amount of energy that water would need to absorb to counteract the heat produced by nuclear decay.

Step 1.1: Energy from Accelerated Nuclear Decay
The total energy released by nuclear decay over a year is given by the number you provided,

 decays per second. To estimate the total energy produced by the radioactive decay, we'll use a rough estimate of the energy released per decay, but we'll keep it simple for this first step.

Energy released per decay: A typical alpha decay produces around 4.8 MeV (Mega electron Volts) of energy.

Comparison of Heat Absorption from Nuclear Decay and Water
Now, compare the total energy released by nuclear decay (

 J/s):

The rate at which water can absorb heat is vastly greater than the energy produced by nuclear decay. Therefore, the water can absorb the energy produced by nuclear decay without experiencing a significant increase in temperature, meaning this doesn't significantly affect the "heat problem."

2. Effect of Salt on Specific Heat Capacity
The presence of salt decreases the specific heat capacity of water. For seawater, the specific heat capacity is approximately 3850 J/kg·°C compared to 4186 J/kg·°C for pure water.

Let’s adjust the calculation for the heat absorbed by seawater with the new specific heat:

This is still significantly higher than the energy produced by nuclear decay, meaning salt does not have a large enough effect to change the conclusion.

3. Evaporation and Heat Removal
As water heats up, it will evaporate, transferring latent heat to the atmosphere. The latent heat of vaporization of water is around 2260 J/g.

To estimate the amount of water evaporated in one second:

This process will remove heat and help cool the water, but it is still a relatively small portion compared to the heat absorbed by water overall. Still, it provides a significant cooling mechanism.

4. Volcanism and Plate Tectonics (CPT Model)
Volcanic activity can provide a cooling effect due to the large amounts of ash and aerosols released into the atmosphere, blocking sunlight. The exact amount of cooling depends on the volume of eruptions. For example, the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora led to a global temperature drop of around 0.5°C for a year.

Increased plate tectonics and subduction would generate volcanic heat, but the cooling from volcanic aerosols could counterbalance it. We would need to model these balances more precisely with specific data, but a modest assumption is that volcanic activity would provide a cooling of several degrees over the year.

5. Runaway Greenhouse Effect
With significant volcanic eruptions, the increase in aerosols and gases such as sulfur dioxide would likely offset some of the warming from the floodwaters. The presence of heat from accelerated tectonics would be offset by cooling from volcanic ash and aerosols, preventing a runaway greenhouse effect.

Conclusion:
High Specific Heat Capacity of Water: Water can absorb the heat produced by nuclear decay without significant heating.
Evaporation: While the evaporation will remove some heat, it doesn’t entirely resolve the energy influx but still provides a cooling effect.
CPT Heat Problem: The heat generated by the accelerated plate movements would be balanced by cooling from volcanism and heat absorption by the water.
Salt’s Effect: Salt reduces the heat capacity slightly, but not enough to significantly alter the outcome.
Volcanic Activity: Volcanic eruptions would provide significant cooling, preventing a runaway greenhouse effect.
